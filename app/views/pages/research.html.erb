										<font color="#293d51">A literature review of studies conducted in the field of social entrepreneurship in the last 30 years showed us that five psychological pillars were crucial to the performance of a social entrepreneur. Those five identified are motivation, creativity, risk taking, openness to change and ethical fiber.

										<font color="#293d51">This stage involved validification process. &nbsp;We had interviews with experts on the relevance and the scope of the psychometric scale. The sample size for the interview in this stage was fifty five. The sample included seven individuals who had experience working with social entrepreneurs, thirty-five students from O.P. Jindal Global University and twelve academicians who posses knowledge and experience in the social entrepreneurship.&nbsp;

										After the validification, we have not come across any new psychological constructs. We have found that many items in the scale were irrelevant, confusing and an unnecessary repetition. Based on the results, we have shortlisted fifty two out of ninety one items to form a new scale. All the pillars and sub pillars remained same in the new scale. We have also revised the likert scale. Two different types of likert scale was designed. One&nbsp;included&nbsp; Always,&nbsp;Sometimes,&nbsp;Rarely&nbsp;and&nbsp;Never&nbsp;(for&nbsp;items&nbsp;that&nbsp;assessed&nbsp;actual&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and&nbsp;attitude) ​
		and&nbsp; the&nbsp;other&nbsp;consisted&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;four&nbsp;categories&nbsp;of&nbsp;​Strongly&nbsp;Agree,&nbsp;Agree,&nbsp;Disagree&nbsp;and&nbsp;Strongly&nbsp; Disagree&nbsp;(for&nbsp;items&nbsp;that&nbsp;assessed&nbsp;perceptions&nbsp;and&nbsp;beliefs). Based on expert advice, some demographic&nbsp;factors&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;entrepreneurship&nbsp;experience&nbsp;and&nbsp;family&nbsp;history&nbsp;were&nbsp;also&nbsp; included.&nbsp;​</p>

									We have used typeform, an online form submission &amp; assessment tool to upload the new scale and asses the data. The aim of this stage was to filter out applicants prior to the more robust selection process. This assessment tool will be circulated among three target audience i.e. a control group and two experimental groups. Control Group will consist of individuals unrelated to social entrepreneurship and the experimental groups will consist of aspiring&nbsp;social&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;and&nbsp;successful&nbsp;social&nbsp; entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>
